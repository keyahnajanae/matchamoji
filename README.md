Match the cards in less time as possible. The more mistakes, the less accuracy you have. Accuracy is measured through smiley faces !

- Click on any card
- Click on another card that may be the first card's match
- Match cards with less moves

## Code Behind Memory Game ##
I used Vanilla Javascript to manipulate the DOM, altered part of the HTML and also styled the game with basic CSS.
    1.created a counter to count the number of moves made by player and timer to know the duration of a play
    2.created a deck of cards that shuffles when game is refreshed
    3. small CSS effects for when a card is matched and/or clicked
    4. create a pop-up modal when player wins game
