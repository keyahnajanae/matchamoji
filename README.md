## Challenge

Match the cards in less time as possible. The more mistakes, the less accuracy you have. Accuracy is measured through smiley faces !

## Instructions 

- Click on any card
- Click on another card that may be the first card's match
- Match cards with less moves

## Code Behind Memory Game

I manipulated the DOM with Vanilla Javascript, altered part of the HTML and also styled the game with basic CSS.
    - created a counter to count the number of moves made by player and timer to know the duration of a play
    - created a deck of cards that shuffles when game is refreshed
    - small CSS effects for when a card is matched and/or clicked
    - create a pop-up modal when player wins game
