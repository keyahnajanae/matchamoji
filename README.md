USER STORIES

Users will be prompted to click on one card and the card will flip over . The user will click on another card, hoping for the two icons to be a match. If the two icons are a match, the icons are locked in and no points are taken away from accuracy smiles :) If it isn't a match, points will be taken away, bringing down accuracy smileys and the icons will flip back over. Once all icons are matched , a congrats screen will appear with game stats and an option to play again . 

#instructions

 Match the cards in less time as possible. The more mistakes, the less accuracy you have. Accuracy is measured through smiley faces !
